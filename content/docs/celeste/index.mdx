## FAQ

<Accordions>
	<Accordion title="Why not Google Docs / Wiki?" className="[&_p:first-child]:mt-0 [&_p:last-child]:mb-0">
    
        I did made a Google Doc and Wiki page.
        
        Initially this website is only for the tool.
        However just using it for the tool feels a bit empty, so I recreated the guide here.

        At least now it looks really nice compared to Google Doc and Wiki page.
