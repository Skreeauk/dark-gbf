I hate to break this to you but, there's no single grid that is always good on every single content.
You want the most foolproof grid? Go for a mix of skill damage and charge attack. It should work on almost all content, even unreleased ones. Unless KMR decided to give us something weird.

## Sample Grid

<Tabs id="magna" items={["M2", "M3"]}>
	<Tab value="M2">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

    <Tab value="M3">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

Grab 2 Abyss Spines, this will be your Ougi specs and HP.

Grab 2 Agonize / Celeste Saber Ater, this will be your Skill supplementals.

Always add Dark Opus and Seraph/Ultima ULB.

The rest? Anything you want.

More HP, More ATK, More Cap Up? you should know the idea by now.
