## How it works

Skill DMG setups relies on supplementals and skill cap up from the grid such as `Agonize` and `PnS`,
as well as characters that can spam skill DMG with ease such as `Lich` and `Magus (Summer)`.

Understanding how to maximize your skill DMG output will make you a better Dark player as
almost all Dark HL setup deaks decent amount of skill DMG.

## Cooking the Setup

Excluding MH and slotting in 2 `PnS` and 2 `Agonize`, the grid would look something like this:

<MDXWeaponGrid
	weapons={[
		0,
        1040314300, 1040314300, 1040911100,
        1040711100, 1040711100, 1040310800,
		0, 0, 0,
	]}
/>

The rest of the slot can be anything you want or whats fitting for the raid.
