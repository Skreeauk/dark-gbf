## Generic Grid Template

<MDXWeaponGrid />

2 Abyss Spines + Dark Opus should cover some of your HP needs in general.

The rest of the slots depend on your playstyle.
If you want to be more tanky, a 3rd Abyss Spine or Zechariah or DEF awaken Revans could be considered for some more HP.

If you rely on Skills to do damage, then slot in some Agonize / Celeste Saber Ater.

If you rely on Ougi to do damage, then you can slot in Fediel Spine to do more Ougi Damage.

What about PnS? It depends on you too, but generally there are not many options that outperforms PnS.

The Opus key also depends on what you want to do.
Generally Prosperity (Progression) / Strength (Stamina) is the go to key.
However if you think you will be low HP in the raid, Enmity can also be a good choice.
