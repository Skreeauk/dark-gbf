## Triggers 100% - 51%

### Body

#### Paradise Lost - Entry

> 30,000 plain DMG to all allies

Make your frontline have 30k+ HP, easily doable with Avatar Spines.

#### Phosphorus - N / Body 95%

> ~210,000 DMG to one ally with the highest ATK

It will 99% aim MC, and Paladin will cap the DMG taken to 10,000.
So just tank it.

#### Iblis - OD

> Multi-hit to random allies, inflicts `Petrified`, `Weakened` and `Slashed`

Make sure that you have Veil, usually from Fediel 1 or Paladin skill.

#### Paradise Lost - OD (Both Body & Wings Full Diamond)

> ~120,000 DMG to all allies

Tank it with a Cut + Light Switch if possible or All-Sub.

#### Axion - Body 85%

> 3 hit, 600% DMG to the ally with the lowest HP

This will aim the character with the lowest remaining HP,
make sure the character has something to tank it with some sort of Cut / Armor / Dodge / Mirror Image.

#### Atheism - Body 75% (If Wing is alive)

> Gain 50% DMG reduction and Debuff Resistance. Can be removed by the respective element

Faa will get DMG Reduction and Debuff Resistance except for one element.
Nothing to do but just hope another person with the respective element clears it.

### Wings

#### Sephiroth - Wings 70%

> Gain clocks, everytime a character dies from Faa / Wings attacks, the clock reduces by 1.
> When the clock reaches 0, raid wipes

Just ignore.

#### Full Diamond

> Small DMG, inflict apples and debuffs

Just ignore.

## Triggers 50% - 0%

### Seven Trumpets - Body / Wings 50%

> Faa becomes blue, attacks are no longer AOE.
> Faa also gains buffs (Labors)

For a newbie, prioritize to clear:

- Labor VIII (5 Ougi in a turn)
- Labor IX (30 hits to body)
- Labor X (Body has 10 debuffs)
- Labor XI (Make Faa do a PL)

### Axion Apocalypse N

> 3 hit to random allies

Just in case, tank it with Cut / Armor / Dodge / Mirror Image.

### Orbital Blackness - OD

> 3 hit to random allies

Just tank it.

### Paradise Lost - OD (Both Body & Wings Full Diamond)

> ~120,000 DMG to all allies

Tank it with a Cut + Light Switch if possible or All-Sub.

### Axion - Body 60%

> 3 hit, 300% DMG to all allies

Just in case, tank it with Cut / Armor.

### Paradise Lost - Full Diamond / Body 35% (When Wings alive)

> ~120,000 DMG to all allies

Tank it with a Cut + Light Switch if possible or All-Sub.

### Gopherwood Ark - Body 25%

> Kill characters with duplicate race

Just ignore.

### Axion Apocalypse - Body 20% & 15%

> 3 hit to random allies

Just in case, tank it with Cut / Armor / Dodge / Mirror Image.

### Paradise Lost - Body 10% & 3%

> 999,999 Elemental DMG

Tank it with 100% Cut / Dodge / Unchallenge on everyone.

## Characters

You want to use characters that can dispel (E.g. Vikala, Halmal, etc.),
apply debuffs (E.g. Halmal, Kou, etc.),
and provide some survivability (E.g. Kou, Lich, etc.).

For reference, a common FA setup would be Paladin, Halmal, Vikala, Lich, Kou, Flex.

<MDXCallout title="Why Vikala over Fediel?">
	I personally prefer Vikala over Fediel. Fediel will not be able to refresh the
	shield and Vikala also provides more utility such as heal, echo and dispel
