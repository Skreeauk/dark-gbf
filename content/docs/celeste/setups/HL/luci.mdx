## Triggers 100% - 51%

### Paradise Lost - Entry

Make your frontline has 30k+ HP, easily doable with Avatar Spines

### Paradise Lost - Full Diamond / Body 35% (When Wings alive)

Use Paladin S1 or All-Sub

### Phosphorus - N / Body 95%

It will 99% aim MC, and Paladin will cap the DMG taken to 10,000.
So just tank it

### Iblis - OD

Make sure that you have Veil, usually from Fediel 1 or Paladin skill

### Axion - Body 85%

This will aim the character with the lowest remaining HP,
make sure the character has something to tank it with some sort of Cut / Armor / Dodge

### Sephiroth - Wings 70%

Faa will gain clocks, everytime a character dies from Faa / Wings attacks, the clock reduces by 1.
When the clock reaches 0, raid wipes

### Atheism - Body 75% (Before Seven Trumptes)

Faa will get DMG Reduction and Debuff Resistance except for one element.
Nothing to do but just hope everything works out

## Triggers 50% - 0%

### Seven Trumpets - Body / Wings 50%

Faa becomes blue, attacks are no longer AOE so Seox S2 can work.

Faa also gains buffs (Labors). For a newbie, prioritize to clear:

- Labor VIII (5 Ougi in a turn)
- Labor IX (30 hits to body)
- Labor X (Body has 10 debuffs)
- Labor XI (Make Faa do a PL)

### Orbital Blackness - OD

Just tank it

### Axion Apocalypse - Body 60%

Just in case, tank it with Cut / Armor

### Paradise Lost - Full Diamond / Body 35% (When Wings alive)

Tank it with a Cut + Light Switch if possible or All-Sub

### Gopherwood Ark - Body 25%

This trigger will kill characters with duplicate race

### Paradise Lost - Body 10% & 3%

This does 999,999 DMG, so basically tank it with 100% Cut / Dodge / Unchallenge on everyone

## Characters

You want to use characters that can dispel (E.g. Vikala, Halmal, etc.),
apply debuffs (E.g. Halmal, Kou, etc.),
and provide some survivability (E.g. Kou, Lich, etc.).

For reference, a common FA setup would be Paladin, Halmal, Vikala, Lich, Kou, Flex.

<MDXCallout title="Why Vikala over Fediel?">
	I personally prefer Vikala over Fediel. Fediel will not be able to refresh the
	shield and Vikala also provides more utility such as heal, echo and dispel
