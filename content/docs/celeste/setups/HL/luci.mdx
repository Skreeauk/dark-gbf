## Sample Grid

<Tabs id="magna" items={["M2", "M3"]}>
	<Tab value="M2">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

    <Tab value="M3">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Characters

You want to use characters that can dispel (E.g. Vikala, Halmal, etc.),
apply debuffs (E.g. Halmal, Kou, etc.),
and provide some survivability (E.g. Kou, Lich, etc.).

For reference, a common FA setup would be Paladin, Halmal, Vikala, Lich, Kou, Flex.

<Callout className="items-center prose-p:my-0">
	I personally prefer Vikala over Fediel. Fediel will not be able to refresh the
	shield and Vikala also provides more utility
</Callout>
