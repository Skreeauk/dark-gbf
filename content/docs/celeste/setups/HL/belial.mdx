The setup to clear this raid has a lot of similarities with Beelzebub's setup.

## Sample Grid

<Tabs id="magna" items={["M2", "M3"]}>
	<Tab value="M2">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

    <Tab value="M3">

    <MDXWeaponGrid />

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Characters

You want to bring 1 character that can delay without pressing skill (E.g. Lich, Tanya, etc.),
apply debuffs (E.g. Lich, etc.),
and provide some survivability (E.g. Fediel, Lich, etc.).

For reference, a common setup would be Kengo, Fediel, Flex, Lich, Flex, Flex.
