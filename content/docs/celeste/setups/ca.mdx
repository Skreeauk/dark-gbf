## How it works

CA DMG setups relies on ougi supplementals and ougi cap up from the grid such as `Fediel Spine` and `Abyss Spine`,
as well as characters that can generate bar or boost allies ougi DMG such as `Lich` and `Fediel`.

Understanding how to maximize your skill DMG output will make you a better Dark player as
almost all Dark HL setup deaks decent amount of skill DMG.

## Cooking the Setup

`PnS` does not give much value for ougi DMG,
but Dark characters usually have some sort of additional nuke such as Seox where he does a multihit nuke upon dodging.
So we would still slot in `PnS`. The grid would look something like this:

<MDXWeaponGrid />

The rest of the slot can be anything you want or whats fitting for the raid.
