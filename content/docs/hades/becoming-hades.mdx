## Why go Hades?

### You like the element

Nothing I say will stop you if you simply like the element so much to go Hades

### Easier time doing Hard Content

Hades usually have an easier time in doing Lucilius / Beelzebub / Belial / Super Ultimate Bahamut,
due to having access to garrison as well as crit
(it's not like Celeste cannot go crit, but Celeste Crit is just despair because it eats 4 slots while Hades only eats 2-3 slots)

## Why You Shouldn't Go Hades?

### You want to skip farming Magna

This is not a valid reason to directly go to Hades as Celeste can still have an easier time than Hades on some content.
For example, Hades ougi options are weaker than Celeste due to having lower numbers.
Another example is on unboosted situations,
you would still use PnS + Celeste Axes as those are your best options for unboosted setups (like farming event VH / EX with Kaguya)

## Becoming a proper Hades

### Having Both Opus-es

Having both Opus, Magna and Primal, gives access to some freedom in your keys/chains.
The Magna Opus is usually using the chain of falsehood (Echo Chain) for bursting setups as usually the grid is already filled with Normal ATK mods,
so the Opus being Magna ATK boosts dmg more than another Normal ATK. (Understand the damage formula).
This doesn’t mean you can’t use Primal Opus Echo Chain,
being Primal Opus means having more HP but less overall dmg (Only used if you care about the HP).

The Primal Opus now has a little bit of freedom on what key/chain to use.
Usually the chain of glorification is used so that Hades can have some Ougi Specs.
Stamina is also decent.
While Freyr Chain can also be used for some setups where you would need the buffs
(but usually Echo Chain just outperforms Freyr Chain).

### Don’t be stingy with resources

Being primal in the current state of GBF means having a lot of weapons to stay ahead of Magna.
There are no `Cheap Hades` anymore. A `Cheap Hades` just loses from a proper Magna
